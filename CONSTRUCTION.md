# Construction 

Courtesy of [Justin](https://github.com/Jbay33), we were able to create a custom cabinet for the arcade machine!

## OnShape CAD Files

The entire arcade machine was made in CAD using OnShape. The links to the CAD files are below:
* [Version 1](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/18b1ac4f782180f367ca0937/w/badeb0611aec4ac05cfecd75/e/7f783bd4ad25b7494e6b3483)
* [Version 2](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/315bdf4c832f21ce41781b81/w/f42f3bce96579a00728c3ae8/e/0c6d825c273a91b7db81a92d)

*These designs are all derived from [this](https://thewoodwhisperer.com/videos/bartop-arcade-raspberry-pi/) design. This [PDF version](https://thewoodwhisperer.com/files/TWW-Arcade-Cabinet-V2.pdf) has also proven to be very useful.*
