# Construction 

Courtesy of [Justin](https://github.com/Jbay33), we were able to create a custom cabinet for the arcade machine!

## OnShape CAD Files

The entire arcade machine was made in CAD using OnShape. The links to the CAD files are below:
* [Version 1](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/18b1ac4f782180f367ca0937/w/badeb0611aec4ac05cfecd75/e/7f783bd4ad25b7494e6b3483)
* [Version 2](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/315bdf4c832f21ce41781b81/w/f42f3bce96579a00728c3ae8/e/0c6d825c273a91b7db81a92d)

*These designs are all derived from [this](https://thewoodwhisperer.com/videos/bartop-arcade-raspberry-pi/) original design. A [PDF version](https://thewoodwhisperer.com/files/TWW-Arcade-Cabinet-V2.pdf) is also available, and has proven to be very convenient.*

Unfortunately, I can't really demonstrate how to build the cabinet step-by-stepâ€”it would just take way too long. However, all of the information that I would've included in a step-by-step guide is available via the OnShape links. 

Once you have cut all of the peices and assembled them, you will be left with a contraption so beautiful and awe-inspiring that it will leave you speechless. A combination of questionable scripting, half-decent design, and improper construction thereof culminating in an (at least somewhat) enjoyable, interactive plaything for many to enjoy. You did it. Congratulations. 

I'm going to sleep.
