# MakeCode Documentation

### This repo is just documentation for an arcade machine that I helped make in highschool

MakeCode Site: <https://arcade.makecode.com>

MakeCode Kiosk Site: <https://arcade.makecode.com/kiosk>

General setup link: <https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/kiosk>

MakeCode's Kiosk version has a few options. These options are added at the end of the URL

These options are: /kiosk?clean=1 and /kiosk?lock=1

The first option will get rid of the default games microsoft puts in the kiosk by default

The second option will not let people add or delete games to the kiosk

You can combine them if you want with /kiosk?lock=1&clean=1

Kids can make their own games on MakeCodes main website to then upload to the kiosk

To upload games to the machine, follow the setup page linked above

That concludes general setup with an already setup machine and games



# How to setup the machine from scratch

### Raspberry pi setup

Assuming it's still using a raspberry pi 4, this should all apply

Download an image of the raspberry pi operating system <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>

Take that raspberry pi image and flash the micro usb with something like [BalenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) or Raspberry pi imager
