MakeCode Documentation

This repo is just documentation for an arcade machine that I helped make in highschool

MakeCode Site: <https://arcade.makecode.com>

MakeCode Kiosk Site: <https://arcade.makecode.com/kiosk>

General setup link: <https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/kiosk>

MakeCode's Kiosk version has a few options. These options are added at the end of the URL

These options are: /kiosk?clean=1 and /kiosk?lock=1

The first option will get rid of the default games microsoft puts in the kiosk by default

The second option will not let people add or delete games to the kiosk

You can combine them if you want with /kiosk?lock=1&clean=1

Kids can make their own games on MakeCodes main website to then upload to the kiosk
